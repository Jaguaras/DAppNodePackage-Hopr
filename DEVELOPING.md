# Repository structure


There are two repositories:

- official: https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNodePackage-Hopr
- internal: https://github.com/hoprnet/DAppNodePackage-Hopr

The `internal` is a fork of the `official` one. 

Tha development happens on the internal repository and it has two branches:

- `develop` which contains the edge version, not meant for publishing
- `main` which is supposed to be in-sync with the `main` branch on the `official` repo


PRs are only meant to be made from the `internal` repo's `main` branch to the `official` repo's `main` branch.
